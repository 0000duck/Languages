<?php
/*
    Function list not reading function names beginning with reserved words for php
    
    If a function is named beginning with a reserved word in php , then the 
    function list window is not able to search that function if searched for 
    using the whole name or beginning letters.

    e.g. in php if we name a function like so:
*/

function forgotPassword()
{
    // some code
}

?>
