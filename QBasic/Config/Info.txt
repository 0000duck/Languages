WARNING! - These procedures may require admin access here and there!

1.) Copy/move the provided .ico files into qb64\source, or find some
    other icons you like and rename them according to the provided ones.

2.) Go into FileTypes.txt and replace all occurences of the text
    "C:\\your\\path\\to\\qb64" with the actual path to your QB64 folder,
    also replace "C:\\your\\path\\to\\npp" with the path to your Notepad++
    folder, make sure to use a double backslash as separator, save changes.
    NOTE: You cannot use system environment variables such as %userprofile%,
          %appdata% etc. here, type absolute paths instead, always begin
          with the drive letter and end with the application folder. For
          example, if you have installed QB64 in "C:\qb64" and Notepad++
          in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++", then replace:
            C:\\your\\path\\to\\qb64 with C:\\qb64
        and C:\\your\\path\\to\\npp with C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Notepad++

3.) Now run regedit.exe either by typing it into a command prompt or into
    the program search field in the Start Menu. In RegEdit select menu
    File > Import and select FileTypes.txt. When done, close RegEdit and
    restart your system to make changes effective.
    NOTE: If you already had other default icons assigned, and these
          still show up instead of the new ones just installed, then it
          could be a icon cache issue. Try to delete the hidden system
          file %localappdata%\IconCache.db (Vista & newer) and restart
          your system again.

Optional, if you like to be able to search your source file contents
for any text or keywords, using the search field of Windows Explorer.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.) Go into Controlpanel > Indexing Options, select Advanced Options
    and then the Filetypes tab, check the extensions .bas, .bi, and
    .bm (add them, if not in list), then select each and switch them to
    fulltext search (ie. index file properties and contents), accept
    all changes.
