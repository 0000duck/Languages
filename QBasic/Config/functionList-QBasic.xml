			|   Based on:
			|       Implementation by RhoSigma 2017/05/22
			|
			|   Note(s):
			|   1)  Does match any active (not commented out) FUNCTION or SUB,
			|       ie. every line starting with FUNCTION or SUB keyword (case
			|       ignored) optionally with leading whitespace (to match also
			|       FUNCTIONs/SUBs in indented DECLARE LIBRARY blocks).
			|       The match displayed in the function list is the entire
			|       FUNCTION/SUB line as found in your source, ie. it includes
			|       the argument list (if any) and a trailing comment (if any),
			|       hence you can use the list not only for quick jumps to any
			|       function in your source, but also as quick reference for
			|       the required arguments and/or any special notes given in
			|       the trailing comment.
			|   2)  Additionally any "Folder in Comment" markers are included.
