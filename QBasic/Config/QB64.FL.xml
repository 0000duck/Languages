            |   Does match any active (not commented out) FUNCTION or SUB,
            |   ie. every line starting with FUNCTION or SUB keyword (case ignored)
            |   optionally with leading whitespace (to match also FUNCTIONs/SUBs in
            |   indented DECLARE LIBRARY blocks). The match displayed in the function
            |   list is the entire FUNCTION/SUB line as found in your source, ie. it
            |   includes the argument list (if any) and a trailing comment (if any),
            |   hence you can use the list not only for quick jumps to any function
            |   in your source, but also as quick reference for the required arguments
            |   and/or any special notes given in the trailing comment.
            |   Additionally any "Folder in Comment" markers are included in the List.
