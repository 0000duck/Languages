ABOUT
This is a pretty syntax for Rebol Language.
It aims to identify rebol system words, view words, question words and program sequence words.
Color scheme selected and classification of words follow my subjective preferences, feel free to experiment

INSTALLATION
(based on the info on the Notepad++ site):
1. Download and unzip Rebol.zip
2. Open %APPDATA%\Notepad++ folder and search for userDefineLang.xml file
3. If there is no file, copy userDefineLang_Rebol.xml to that folder and rename to userDefineLang.xml
4. Otherwise, append contents of userDefineLang_Rebol.xml to the end userDefineLang.xml and remove spurious </Notepad_Plus><Notepad_plus> than remains in the middle of the file and save the edited userDefineLang.xml
