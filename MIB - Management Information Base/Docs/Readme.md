# MIB - Management Information Base

.mib

## Description

A management information base (MIB) is a database used for managing the entities
in a communication network. Most often associated with the Simple Network 
Management Protocol (SNMP), the term is also used more generically in contexts 
such as in OSI/ISO Network management model. While intended to refer to the 
complete collection of management information available on an entity, it is 
often used to refer to a particular subset, more correctly referred to as 
MIB-module.

Objects in the MIB are defined using a subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One 
(ASN.1) called "Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2)" RFC 2578. 
The software that performs the parsing is a MIB compiler.

The database is hierarchical (tree-structured) and each entry is addressed 
through an object identifier (OID). Internet documentation RFCs discuss MIBs, 
notably RFC 1155, "Structure and Identification of Management Information for 
TCP/IP based internets", and its two companions, RFC 1213, "Management 
Information Base for Network Management of TCP/IP-based internets", and RFC 
1157, "A Simple Network Management Protocol".
