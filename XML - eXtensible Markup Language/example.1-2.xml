<h2>Using a Comment</h2>
<div id="commentExample">
<!--
Within this comment I can use ]]>
and other reserved characters like <
&, ', and ", but %MyParamEntity; will not be expanded
(if I retrieve the text of this node it will contain
%MyParamEntity; and not "Has been expanded")
and I can't place two dashes next to each other.
-->
</div>

<h2>Using a CDATA Section</h2>
<div id="cdataExample">
<![CDATA[
Within this Character Data block I can
use double dashes as much as I want (along with <, &, ', and ")
*and* %MyParamEntity; will be expanded to the text
"Has been expanded" ... however, I can't use
the CEND sequence (if I need to use it I must escape one of the
brackets or the greater-than sign).
