# APMonitor Modeling Language

## Description

The APMonitor Modeling Language is optimization software for mixed-integer and 
differential algebraic equations. It is coupled with large-scale solvers for 
linear, quadratic, nonlinear, and mixed integer programming (LP, QP, NLP, MILP, 
MINLP). Modes of operation include data reconciliation, real-time optimization, 
dynamic simulation, and nonlinear predictive control. It is freely available 
through MATLAB, Python, or from a web browser interface.
