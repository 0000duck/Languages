Notepad++ User Defined Language - Assembly for PIC16F628A Microcontroller

PIC's are microcontrollers from Microchip. Since PIC16F628A is one the most used PIC's by the hobbyst community (me included) I decided
to make this file and share it with all.

---

ALL Assembly Intructions for ALL Midrange PIC's are covered.
ALL Microchip Assembler Compiler (MPASM) directives are covered.
ALL Assembly Operators are covered.

This way, this 'User Defined Language' file can be used to easily code Assembly for ALL Midrange PIC Microcontrollers.

PIC Registers, Register Bits and Configuration Bits are very device depended.
Because of this I only added 100% coverage of PIC16F628A (and PIC16F628).

The best way to add this 'User Defined Language' to your Notepad++ installation is to use the User Language Define Dialog
'Menu -> View -> User-Defined Dialogue' and then click 'Import' and select the .xml file I supply. Restart Notepad++ and the
PIC Assembly Language will be added at the end of the 'Language' menu.


Hope it is useful.
