ABOUT
This is a pretty simple list:
All PowerShell commands (via Get-Command)
All PowerShell aliases (via Get-Alias)
Common WMI classes (via docs)
PowerShell syntax, operators, etc. (via docs)

INSTALLATION
(based on the info on the Notepad++ site):
1. Download and unzip userDefineLang_PowerShell.xml
2. Open the file with your favourite text editor (such as notepad++ or notepad)
3. Click start, run, type (or paste in) %APPDATA%\Notepad++ then click ok
4. Open userDefineLang.xml with a text editor
5. If this is the first userdefined language you are adding, copy/paste the entire first file (userDefineLang_PowerShell.xml) into the userDefineLang.xml, replacing all that was there. If this is the second or more language you add, simply copy everything from the first file starting at <UserLang...> to </UserLang> and paste it at the end of the userDefineLang.xml right before </NotepadPlus>
6. Save the newly improved userDefineLang.xml
